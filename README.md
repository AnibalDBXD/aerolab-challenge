# Aerolab-Challenge

- Each product should have a visible price in points.

- The user should be able to sort products by price, from highest to lowest, and vice-versa.

- The user should be able to see how many points they have in their account.

- There should be a clear way for the user to distinguish those products that they can redeem from those they cannot.

- A “Redeem” button should be available for those products that the user has enough points to claim.

- A “Redeem now” option should appear when the user interacts with a product that they have enough points to claim.

- When the user doesn’t have enough points for a product, they should be able to see how many more points they need to claim it.

- The user should not be able to redeem a product for which they don’t have enough points.

- When the user clicks on the Redeem now button, the system should automatically deduct the item’s price from the users’ points.
